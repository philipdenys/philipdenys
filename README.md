Hello! I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for problem-solving. I love discovering new tools and methods that can enhance my development skills, and I'm always eager to learn and grow as a programmer. Currently, I'm focused on evolving my SuiteScript development skills, and I'm utilizing CI/CD with SDF in our NetSuite environments. 

My favorite programming language is JavaScript, and I have experience working with REST APIs. If you're looking for a driven and dedicated developer, I would love to connect and see how I can contribute to your projects.
